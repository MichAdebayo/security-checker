## 🔧 Configuration

The system uses environment-based configuration with sensible defaults:

### Model Configuration
- **Local Model**: `model/best.pt` - Custom-trained PPE detection model
- **Detection Classes**: Helmet, Mask, Safety Vest, Person, and violation classes
- **Confidence Threshold**: Adjustable per-page (default varies by use case)

### Virtual Environment
The app uses a dedicated virtual environment (`yolo_env/`) with optimized dependencies:
- **PyTorch**: GPU-accelerated inference (when available)
- **Ultralytics YOLO**: Latest YOLO implementation
- **OpenCV**: Computer vision processing
- **Streamlit**: Web interface framework

## 🎯 Detection Classes

The custom-trained model detects the following PPE items and violations:

### ✅ Positive PPE Detection
- **🪖 Helmet/Hard Hat** - Safety headgear compliance
- **😷 Mask** - Face covering detection  
- **🦺 Safety Vest** - High-visibility clothing detection
- **👤 Person** - Human detection for context

### ❌ Violation Detection
- **NO-Helmet** - Missing headgear violations
- **NO-Mask** - Missing face covering violations
- **NO-Safety Vest** - Missing vest violations

### 🚧 Environment Detection
- **Safety Cone** - Work zone markers
- **Machinery** - Industrial equipment
- **Vehicle** - Construction vehicles

## ⚡ Performance & Architecture

### Direct YOLO Integration
The system uses direct integration with a custom-trained YOLO model:

```bash
# Custom model trained specifically for PPE detection
# Optimized for construction and industrial environments
# Real-time processing with dedicated virtual environment
```

**Architecture Benefits:**
- **Custom Training** - Model specifically trained on PPE scenarios
- **Fast Inference** - Direct model access with optimized environment
- **No Network Dependencies** - Completely offline processing
- **Memory Efficient** - Model loads once and stays in memory
- **Privacy Focused** - No data transmission to external services

### Key Features
1. **Real-time Tracking** - DeepSORT integration for person tracking in videos
2. **Compliance Metrics** - Continuous calculation based on all 3 PPE items
3. **Audio Alerts** - Customizable sound notifications for violations
4. **Multi-format Support** - Images, videos, and live webcam streams
